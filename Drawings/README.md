# Choclate Mold
In the beginning i was using various tools that where more handy to do the job. The 'AgileFloppy.svg' drawing was created using Affinity Designer on MacOSX. 
This file was then imported into Fusion360 (Startup License) to create the CAM jobs. 'Trace' was used to engrave lines, 'Engrave' for the Text and '2D Contour' to do the cut. 
The 'DisketteBox.svg' was created using TouchDraw on iOS/iPad.
