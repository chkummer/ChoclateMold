# Choclate Mold
In my day job i work as an UNIX Systems Engineer in a company that experimeting with Agile / DevOps. Because this is an experiment most of the projects and applications are managed by waterfallen. Agile and DevOps is on top of that and is causing some overtime. To sweeten up such a day wouldn't it be nice to have a choclate in a diskette form? Where would one store these choclate diskettes? In a Diskette Box?
Okay that sounds like a plan. Let's do it.
